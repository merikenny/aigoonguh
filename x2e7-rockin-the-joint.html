The form of dance that it spawned, Slow Drag, was a sensual lumbering and in many ways erotic hip gyrating two partner dance which African Americans indulged in with libidinous abandon in the backwoods of the juke joints which popped up in the Southern country fields of the South after the Civil War.

When visiting my bro last year, we stumbled upon Chomp Rockin in Fullerton where they have AYCE (included sushi and crab legs among other things) AND bottomless mimosas for a decent price on a Sunday.
