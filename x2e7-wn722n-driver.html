                            <p>So recently I've bought the TL-WN722N and upon trying to install it I've encountered some errors. The setup doesn't autorun (I think this is quite common?) but when trying to run the executable it doesn't work either, taking me to archive manager and then displaying the message 'An error occurred while loading the archive'. SO I did some research and found this: https://github.com/erickcion/tlwn722n-linux-install I downloaded the files but there is a line that the creator Hello everyone I'm having trouble with installing drivers for TP-LINK TP-WN722N wireless usb adapter in Fedora 25 as it is not recognized automatically. I have tried installing it by following this (https://github.com/ebirbe/tlwn722n-linux-install) and debuggin with the help of this (https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-networking-3/need-help-with-tl-wn722n-installation-on-fedora-25-a-4175605160/) to no avail. It is not showing with lsusb at all. Any ideas? uname  For the last 4 hours I've been trying to get a connection to a WPA-secured wireless network via wpa_supplicant going, the result is nothing but a series of miserable failures. The distro is Ubuntu 12.04, the wireless adapter in question is a TL-WN722N, driver and firmware are installed and the adapter is visible under iwconfig and scanning for wireless networks via iwlist works as well. The only problem is connecting the damn thing to a network with WPA. Here's the wpa_supplicant.conf. Hi Guys i have been trying to install drivers for my TL-WN722N for the past 3 days with no luck, I have been working off the advice off a few hundred forum posts trying to get this thing to work but nothing that has been suggested seems to do the trick. THE ISSUE: when attempting to run the "sudo make" command to install the driver from the Make file the following error appears make 1 : Entering directory '/lib/modules/4.9.0-kali3-amd64/build' make 1 : No rule to make target 'modules'. 
My system is a Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit. My drivers for my TP-LINK are old (from 2011 I believe) and I went to the download page, but am a bit confused. I see two links for drivers, but the second link says beta drivers, while the first link says "Operating Systems: WinXp/Vista/7/8" but then the notes says "For Windows 8". So I am confused, which driver am I supposed to download or do I have to download I've been stuck on this for a bit, can someone help me out on this. I have the tar, I've tried running the make file, and it's giving me errors. Let's just assume I'm doing this ass backwards, can someone just tell me how to install this tar file correctly. I'm a noob, but found out that I cannot do anything fun using default wireless receiver on my Mac so ordered TL-WN722N right away. But sadly, the device I got was 1.10 and I guess the company doesn't make driver for Mac. Would installing Windows on bootcamp (instead of virtualbox) help? I'm planning on installing Hi all, I'm trying to run Kali Linux in Virtual Box on a Macbook Pro. I've got a ASUS AC51 Wifi adapter which will only run on El Capitan. If I upgrade to Sierra, the laptop has a meltdown and won't recognise the hard drive! So I've got the wifi adapter plugged in. If I go into terminal and type in "airmon-ng", then press enter, I get a message that says, "ls: cannot access '/sys/class/ieee80211/' : No such file or directory" What do I need to do? Is the wifi adapter even suitable?. From what I've seen, some people say Tp-Link TL-WN722N or Tp-Link TL-WN722N v1. Are they different models? Different drivers? Different version? But from what I can see, the v1 doesn't really matter I've looked at Alfa and Hawking USB models and cannot find out which ones will a) support packet injection, and b) have the right chipset for 10.10.x. Anyone out there have info on this? Correction: The title shouldn't say "conflicting info". I don't know where Hi all, fairly new here and I recently got Windows 98 up and running great on my grandma's old computer, it was originally running Windows XP but wanted to go back to 98 for better DOS compatibility and since it seemed to make more sense considering the machine's specs. I have a spare TP-Link TL-WN722N wifi USB adapter which worked fine on the machine with XP installed, however the manufacturer's website's drivers only seem to support XP and up. I looked into getting some different kinds I have a Raspberry Pi Model B Plus Rev 1.2 with raspbian running the 4.14.98+ Kernel. I have connected a TP-LINK TL-WN722N USB Wifi dongle: Bus 001 Device 005: ID 0cf3:9271 Atheros Communications, Inc. AR9271 802.11n I am using dnsmasq and hostap to set it up as an Access Point. It works absolutely great, but after some time it seems that it crashes with a message: 265945.214597 ------------ cut here ------------ 265945.215805 WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 14319 at net/m. 
Hi all! I've been using Linux for a couple weeks now as a complete daily driver. I still have my Windows install on my other SSD just in case but so far ridiculously happy. Anyway specs are: POP-OS 18.04 (I think?) 4.18.0-17-generic (kernal) X470 AORUS ULTRA GAMING AMD RYZEN 5 2600X 16GB 2133MHz DDR4 MSI GTX980 My current network adapter is Belkin Components F7D1101 v1 Basic Wireless Adapter Realtek RTL8188SU This one worked out of the box (really old network adapter I always Hello everyone! Im not very new to linux, but new to ubuntu, i installed ubuntu recently as my main OS, my standard wifi card that comes with the PC is really crap, so i decided to use my awus036ACH Alfa wifi adapter which i used to use on linux for penetration testing. anyway i downloaded the driver from the disc which came with the adapter, i did everything as i should but i ran into an error when i was going to 'make' the file using the make command, i then downloaded the same driver. So here's the deal: I got an old TL-WN722N USB Wi-Fi thing that I use to connect to the internet. Since the thing is kinda obsolete and I in fact had a few BSOD thanks to the drivers, I decided to get a new one. I tried a couple of USB based ones (that thanks God I was able to return) that didn't work. So I decided to get a PCI-Express one, since I believed they were more stable. After a quick research got a TL-WN881ND V2, got yesterday, installed flawlessly (I even removed the old drivers. I've got adapter TP-Link wn722n and I try to enable monitor mode in Kali linux (in virtual box) but I cant. I know there is a trouble with driver for adapter, I watched a lot video tutorials how to fix it but it still doesnt work( Maybe somebody I want to use Wifi on my MBA 13" when in live usb mode but the problem is that I need a driver and its a very tedious process and i dont have any knoledge about it. Should i get a wireless card? I just want to access the internet. Please reccomend a wireless card! Is TP-Link TL-WN722N compatible with Macbook So for a start I've been using the TP-Link TL-WN722N for well over 12 months now and never had any issues. The adapter did what it was meant to, but had mediocre range. It finally died on me and I bought the Alfa AWUS036ACH, a newly supported card. I figured it would be great since the card support virtual AP's and monitor mode. The card works perfectly fine on a windows environment and probably OSX too. I booted up linux and after about an hour of purging and reinstalling packages and driver. I have a MacBook Air 11 Late 2012 which is running Linux since I bought it. It's a great Linux machine. It was Linus daily driver for a long time. Every component is Intel, except for a stupid Broadcom BCM43224 wireless card. Completely useless no matter what firmware you use. It has really short range. Fine. I've bought what is supposedly _the_ wireless adapter. An Alfa AWUSO36NHA, powered by Atheros AR9271. It's sanctioned by FSF, it has a kernel driver, redistributable firmware Hiii, I need help i am stuck. I need a wlan adapter in monitor mode but nothing seems to work. Sudo Apt-get update,sudo apt-upgrade, broadcom driver update but airdump-ng wlan0 does nothing but say he can not put the divice in monitor mode and can not work. Any suggestions? Model number: tp-link TL-WN722N. 
I bought a WAE3220 (Broadcom BCM94322) wireless network card because I had some weird issues going via USB WiFi (TL-WN722N). The TP Link USB always gave me the full 10 MBit/s speed my ISP provides but this new card (WAE3220) doesn't even though it's advertised to go up to 300 MBit/s. I've tried updating the drivers and disabling/enabling it with Device Manager on W10 but nothing changed. Hey guys, Im building my first gaming pc over the weekend and I have just about everything. I got my wifi adaptor, which is a TP-LINK TL-WN722N, and you have to install the driver with a CD, and I dont have a disc drive. Is there anyway I can bypass. root@kali2018:~/kernel/drivers/TL-WN722N_v2.0-Ralink/rtl8188EUS_linux_v4.3.0.8_13968.20150417# make install " " "NO SKRC,we will use default KSRC" " " install -p -m 644 8188eu.ko /lib/modules/4.15.0-kali2-amd64/kernel/drivers/net/wireless/ install: cannot stat '8188eu.ko': No such file or directory Makefile:1374: recipe for target 'install' failed make: install Error 1 Just started learning Day 3 of installa. </p>
